## Portfolio Philosophy
TKEL Forge Analytics approaches data analysis as a decision-support discipline rather than a purely technical exercise. Every dataset represents a real operational story, and every analysis is structured to surface meaningful, actionable insight.

The objective is not simply correct analysis — but useful insight that supports confident decision-making.
