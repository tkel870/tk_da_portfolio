# Executive Summary — Player Behavior & Game Performance Analytics

This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of simulated player telemetry generated for a fictional live-service game. The analysis focuses on key metrics that drive data-informed decisions across product, live operations, and business strategy.

---

## 🎮 Engagement Trends

**Daily Active Users (DAU)** and **Weekly Active Users (WAU)** show consistent player engagement over the observation period. These metrics provide a high-level view of activity fluctuations and help stakeholders understand player behavior on both short and medium time scales.

---

## 📉 Retention

The retention analysis reveals:
- ~38% day-1 retention
- ~23% day-7 retention
- ~5% day-30 retention

This pattern of early drop-off followed by a stable long-term core audience aligns with common live-service engagement curves, suggesting that the game retains a meaningful core of players beyond initial installs.

---

## 💰 Monetization

The computed **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** of **$8.13** indicates a balanced monetization profile for the simulated dataset. This value is within realistic ranges for free-to-play titles with cosmetic and boost purchases.

## 🧪 A/B Test Evaluation

The dashboard compares player performance across two groups: **Control** and **Variant** (reflecting a simulated feature release).

Analysis shows:

| Metric                     | Control | Variant |
|---------------------------|---------|---------|
| Avg. Sessions per Player  | 6.93    | 7.54    |
| Avg. Minutes per Player   | 247.13  | 284.49  |
| Avg. Revenue per Player   | $12.44  | $15.98  |

These results demonstrate that the Variant group outperformed Control across all key engagement and monetization metrics. This suggests that the tested feature improved player interaction and value generation without negative side-effects on behavior.

## 📈 Summary of Insights

- **Engagement**: Daily and weekly activity show a healthy play cadence.
- **Retention**: A realistic drop-off curve, with a stable core.
- **Monetization**: Solid ARPU supporting sustainable revenue.
- **Experimentation**: Feature variants can be validated and quantified effectively.

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

For future iterations, recommended analyses include:
- Segmenting metrics by player cohort (region/platform)
- Examining purchase frequency by item type
- Longitudinal analysis with additional feature flag experiments
