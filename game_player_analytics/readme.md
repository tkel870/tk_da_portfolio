# Player Behavior & Game Performance Analytics

## Overview
This project analyzes simulated player telemetry for a fictional live-service video game.  
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end analytics skills including data generation, SQL analysis, A/B testing, and dashboard storytelling.

## Tools Used
- Python (data generation)
- Google BigQuery (SQL analysis)
- Tableau Public (dashboard visualization)

## Key Analyses
- Daily & Weekly Active Users (DAU / WAU)
- Player retention (Day 1 / Day 7 / Day 30)
- Monetization (ARPU)
- A/B test analysis (Control vs Variant)

## Dashboard

## Highlights
- Variant group showed higher engagement and monetization
- ~28% increase in average revenue per player
- Retention curve aligned with real-world live-service patterns

## Repository Structure
- `python/` – Data generation scripts
- `sql/` – Validation and analysis queries
- `dashboard/` – Visualization assets
- `executive_summary.md` – Stakeholder-facing insights

## Notes
