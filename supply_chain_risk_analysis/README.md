🏭 Heavy Equipment Supply Chain & Production Risk Analysis
Cost Drivers • Supplier Risk • Production Downtime Intelligence
📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes manufacturing supply chain and production data to identify cost drivers, high-risk suppliers, and operational disruption patterns within a heavy equipment production environment.

The objective was to simulate a real-world operations analytics engagement by transforming raw production and supply chain data into actionable insights for manufacturing and procurement leadership.

The analysis focuses on identifying:

Components responsible for the highest financial loss

Supplier-driven cost and downtime risk

Production downtime patterns by category

Operational risk concentration across the supply chain

This project demonstrates how analytics supports proactive decision-making in manufacturing, logistics, and procurement environments.

🎯 Business Problem

Manufacturing operations face significant financial impact from:

Supplier delays

Production downtime

Defect rates

High-risk components

These risks are often distributed across multiple systems and difficult to analyze holistically.

This project consolidates production, supplier, and defect data to answer:

Which components and suppliers are driving the highest operational cost and risk?

🧰 Tools & Technologies

SQL (SQLite)

Python (data generation & preparation)

Tableau (executive dashboard)

GitHub (documentation & version control)

🗂 Dataset

A manufacturing-style supply chain dataset was used to simulate a heavy equipment production environment including:

Suppliers

Parts and categories

Production output

Downtime

Defects

Shipping performance

The dataset was structured and analyzed to mirror real-world manufacturing operations analytics scenarios.

🔍 Analysis Performed
SQL Analysis

Production and shipment performance review

Supplier risk scoring (downtime + defects + transit delays)

Part-level cost impact analysis

Identification of highest-loss components

Aggregated operational risk metrics

Python Processing

Data structuring and preparation

Dataset generation and transformation for analysis

💡 Key Insights

A small subset of components drives the majority of downtime and defect-related cost exposure

Several suppliers show significantly higher operational risk due to combined downtime and defect rates

Downtime concentration varies across production categories

Proactive supplier and component monitoring can significantly reduce operational loss

📈 Business Value

This analysis demonstrates how manufacturing and supply chain data can be transformed into operational intelligence to:

Reduce production cost exposure

Improve supplier performance visibility

Identify production bottlenecks

Support data-driven procurement decisions

🚀 Portfolio Focus

Designed to showcase analytics capabilities for:

Data Analyst roles

Supply Chain Analytics

Manufacturing & Operations Analytics

Procurement & Vendor Risk Analysis

This project emphasizes real-world business application of SQL, Python, and Tableau in an operations environment.
