Heavy Equipment Supply Chain Risk & Cost Analysis
Capstone Case Study
Business Scenario

Manufacturing and heavy equipment production environments depend on reliable suppliers, efficient production flow, and consistent component quality. Disruptions such as defective parts, shipment delays, and production downtime can create significant operational and financial risk.

This case study analyzes a simulated heavy equipment manufacturing dataset to identify cost drivers, supplier risk exposure, and production disruption patterns. The objective is to demonstrate how data analytics can support operational decision-making in manufacturing and supply chain environments.

Business Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering key operational questions:

Which components generate the highest total cost impact?

Which suppliers contribute most to production risk and financial exposure?

Where is downtime most concentrated across production categories?

How can operations and procurement teams prioritize risk mitigation?

The intended audience includes operations leaders, supply chain managers, and procurement decision-makers.

Tools & Technologies

SQL (SQLite) for relational analysis and aggregation

Python for dataset structuring and preparation

Tableau for executive dashboard visualization

GitHub for documentation and version control

This workflow mirrors real-world analytics processes used in manufacturing and operations environments.

Data Preparation

The dataset represents a manufacturing-style supply chain environment including:

Suppliers

Parts and production categories

Production output

Defects and downtime

Operational cost impact

Data was structured into relational tables and validated to ensure consistency across suppliers, parts, and production records. SQL was used to aggregate downtime, defect counts, and cost impact across multiple dimensions.

Analysis Approach
Ask

Define key operational risk and cost questions affecting manufacturing performance.

Prepare

Structure and validate production and supplier data for relational analysis.

Process

Clean and organize data to ensure accurate aggregation of downtime, defects, and cost impact.

Analyze

Perform SQL analysis to identify:

Highest cost-impact components

Supplier-level operational risk

Downtime concentration by category

Combined cost exposure across production drivers

Share

Develop an executive Tableau dashboard highlighting cost drivers, supplier risk, and operational disruption.

Act

Provide recommendations for monitoring high-risk suppliers, reducing downtime drivers, and improving operational efficiency.

Key Insights

A small subset of components drives the majority of operational cost exposure

Certain suppliers present significantly higher combined downtime and defect risk

Production downtime is concentrated within specific component categories

Monitoring supplier and component performance enables targeted cost reduction

Business Recommendations

Organizations can reduce operational risk and cost exposure by:

Prioritizing review of high-impact components

Monitoring supplier performance and reliability

Addressing categories with high downtime concentration

Implementing ongoing performance tracking dashboards

Visualization

An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to present findings in an executive-ready format:

The dashboard highlights cost drivers, supplier risk exposure, and production disruption patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

Portfolio & Professional Value

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Perform end-to-end data analysis using SQL, Python, and Tableau

Analyze manufacturing and supply chain operations data

Translate raw data into executive-level insights

Communicate findings through clear visualizations and business recommendations

The workflow reflects real-world analytics practices used in operations, supply chain, and manufacturing intelligence roles.
